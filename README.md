# Grand-Theft-Autonomous-Mobile-Robot-

This project entails the development of a mobile autonomous robot with advanced sensing and communication capabilities. The robot exhibits autonomous wall-following behavior, precise localization through Vive system integration, and employs infrared beacon tracking for targeted navigation. Notably, it communicates using communication protocols such as UDP and ESPNow, enabling dynamic interaction. The robotâ€™s proficiency is demonstrated by its ability to autonomously manipulate objects, including grabbing a real trophy, pushing a fake trophy and a police car with precision, highlighting its adaptability in practical applications.

Details of the code structure and implementation are in the [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/RenuReddyK/Grand-Theft-Autonomous-Mobile-Robot-/blob/main/MEAM_5100_Final_Report.pdf)
